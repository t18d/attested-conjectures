# Extra‐stemmatic Readings

Recentiores, non deteriores.

… if an authentic reading could survive once in this way in a single not very early copy, it might do so elsewhere. Clearly it will not do to ascribe any inherently plausible reading found only in late MSS to ‘conjecture’ without first considering when and under what circumstances the postulated emendator may reasonably be imagined to have worked – which is a historical question.

A propensity to emendation, so far from discrediting a manuscript, may be symptomatic of an interest in the text that also prompted the consultation of out-of-the-way copies.

## Lucan.
_The Transmission of the Text of Lucan in the Ninth Century_ (Gotoff)

> By and large, freehand correction, even of the most obvious errors, cannot be proved by the Lucan manuscripts to have been practiced in the ninth century. While some obvious corruptions may have been corrected without reference to another manuscript, the number of impossible readings entered into texts by correctors indicates that they were misreading or slavishly following mistakes in other manuscripts.

## Lucr.
[Zetzel on Butterfield](https://doi.org/10.1353/ajp.2015.0023)

> One perennial issue is the fifteenth-century Italian manuscripts. Their source is a copy made for Poggio in 1417; what is uncertain is the source of Poggio’s copy: an extant manuscript, or an independent source? … Butterfield offers no real arguments against the use of another manuscript by any of the correctors of O, just assertions of what he finds probable; but the conjectural interest and ability he posits for ninth-century monks are anachronistic.… In a desperate attempt to avoid recognizing the obvious, that O<sup>3</sup> employed another manuscript, Butterfield claims that O<sup>3</sup> used _aliter_ to introduce a conjecture, a word used elsewhere only to introduce variants of collation. Most students of the subject believe that Carolingian scribes rarely if ever conjecture: they collate.… I now think it all but certain that at least one of the correctors, and possibly the source of Poggio’s copy, did have access to other readings – perhaps a separate manuscript, perhaps only variants in the archetype itself.

## Ov.
[Towards a New Edition of Ovid’s _Ibis_](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26360789) (Keeline)

> **o** presents us with a large number of good extra-stemmatic readings that were not found in the archetype and that could not or would not have been conjectured by contemporary humanist correctors. It seems very possible that the copyist of **o** had access to a manuscript that lies outside our tradition and that preserved true and valuable readings.

## Tac.
[In Defence of the Leiden Tacitus](http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/110/Wellesley.pdf) (Wellesley)

> This juxtaposition of nonsense and of something a good deal better than common sense is our best guarantee that the good readings in L are not the product of an eccentric and gifted emendator, but reflect a tradition independent of, and in some ways superior to, that of the Second Medicean.
